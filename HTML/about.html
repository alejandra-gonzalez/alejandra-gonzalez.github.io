        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        My name is Alejandra, but I prefer being called Ale or Alex. I'm a 23 year old from California :)<br>
        I'm a little "baby dev" (term coined by my best friend) with a lot of hopes, dreams, hobbies and interests!
        <h2>General</h2>
        <ul><li>I knew I was interested in web development since messing around with HTML and CSS in high school.</li><li>The first programming language I learned, and the one I'm most comfortable with, is Java.</li><li>Once I learned that you can create Android apps with Java, Android development became one of my interests too.</li><li>I have no professional software experience, but I'm hoping that will change soon!</li><li>I really like learning new things, but for now I'll be focusing ondoing more with JavaScript.</li></ul>
        <h2>History</h2>
        I remember the day my family received our first desktop computer. For some reason, we received a bunch of CD-Roms with it.
        There were a few math games for kids, but many of them were educational and looked like they were made for people of ages 13 and up.
        I was only 5 at the time, so I was only really interested in playing the math games on our new Windows computer. I learned how 
        to use the computer at home and at school. As I got older, I spent more time using the internet than the CD-Roms we had. I 
        remember looking up information for school reports and reading about the solar system. I played a lot of games on everythinggirl.com,
        especially the MyScene makeover game. The Barbie ones were fun too.<br><br>My sister made a MySpace account for herself and later on, she
        would make an account for me. Around my freshman year of high school, I eventually grew bored of my personal account and made an account for a fictional character. That
        changed my life. I made friends with other people, and I learned how to use Photoshop CS3 to make nicer images for my account. 
        Later on, this community would move to a different site that looked like MySpace 1.0, where I met more people. I started developing 
        an interest in making my own layouts. Luckily, I had a friend who wrote series of blogs on how to use HTML and CSS to make said layouts.
        <br><br>I would occasionally offer to help others on the site with their own layouts. Sometimes the person would have a design ready, but other 
        times I would have to come up with one. I noticed that I preferred writing code for a completed design than coming up with my own. I stayed 
        on that site for years, writing HTML and CSS to change up my layout every few months.<br><br>When I was applying to colleges, all I knew
        was that I liked writing HTML and CSS. I remember applying to a few UCs and Cal States with either a computer science major 
        (I didn't know about the term "web design" at the time) or marine biology. I remember having to choose between Cal State Long Beach and 
        UC Irvine. A game of eenie meanie mine mo lead to me persuing a Bachelor's in computer science at Cal State Long Beach. The computer
        science classes there were very different from what I was expecting to learn, especially programming with Java, but I liked it. So I kept
        going through my computer science courses.<br><br>It wasn't until junior year that I started putting things together. I was selected for a
        program called "Google Applied CS", where I learned a bit about Android development in Java. I wanted to learn more. A year after that, I began 
        my senior project class. It was a two semester class, and in the first semester, I joined a group to work on a web application we called Event Hopper.
        I had so much fun learning about JavaScript, Node, Express, and MongoDB. Pair programming and working with others was so much fun!
        The following semester was full of hard work, learning, fun, and more projects.
